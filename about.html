            Thomas Jeffrey Hanks or also known as Tom Hanks, he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is regarded as an American cultural icon. 
            Hanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California, and transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years. During his years 
            studying theater, Hanks met Vincent Dowling, head of the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio.At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the 
            festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management,
            prompting Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as Proteus in 
            Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona, one of the few times he played a villain.

        <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 100%;"> 
            In 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film He Knows You're Alone (1980).
            Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has said his acting 
            in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his "modern era of moviemaking because enough 
            self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top". This "modern era" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with Sleepless 
            in Seattle and then with Philadelphia. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves.[50] Richard Schickel 
            of TIME called his performance "charming," and most critics agreed that Hanks's portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.

            In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds (16 kg) and thinned his hair in order to appear 
            sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, "Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a 
            character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar." Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award 
            for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia.During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate 
            John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.

            Hanks followed Philadelphia with the 1994 hit Forrest Gump which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office.Hanks remarked: 
            "When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel some hope for their lot and their
            position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do." Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his 
            role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, 
            winning in 1937-38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.)

            In 2022, Hanks starred as Tom Parker, the sole manager of Elvis Presley, in Elvis, directed by Baz Luhrmann. Shooting commenced in the beginning of 
            2020 in Queensland, Australia.[138] The film was released in June 2022.

            In November 2018, it was reported that Hanks was in talks to portray Geppetto in Walt Disney Studios' live-action adaptation of Pinocchio.
            His involvement in the film, which was directed by his longtime collaborator Zemeckis, was officially confirmed in December 2020.
