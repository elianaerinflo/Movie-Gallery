    <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    Victor Navroski (Tom Hanks) arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport from the fictional country of Krakozia. A war breaks out in his country and he
    finds himself caught up in international politics. Because of the war, the Department of Homeland Security won't let him enter the United States, Krakozia, has fallen 
    in a coup. Therefore his passport and visa are worthless, his country no loger exists, and he cannot go forward or go back. Frank Dixon the customs official 
    (Stanley Tucci) tells him he is free to remain in the International Arrivals Lounge, but forbidden to step foot on American soil. So, Victor settles in at the
    terminal with only his luggage and a Planters peanut can. Viktor finds a gate currently under renovation, and makes it his home. All the while, Dixon is determined to
    get Viktor out of the airport and make him someone else's problem. He tries to get Viktor to leave by luring him out of the airport by ordering guards away from the 
    exit for 5 minutes, but it fails. Dixon then tries to get Viktor to claim asylum if he is fearfulof returning home, so he can leave the airport, but it also fails due to
    Viktor claiming that he is not scared of his own country. Meanwhile, Viktor befriends and assists several airport employees and travelers. Among them is a
    flight attendant named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whom he sees periodically and tries to woo, after she mistakes him for a building contractor who is 
    frequently traveling. One day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions her regarding Viktor and his mysterious peanut can. Amelia, who realizes Viktor has not been 
    entirely truthful, confronts him at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the "A Great Day in Harlem" photograph. 
    His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the 
    musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After nine months, 
    his friends wake Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended, and he can get a green stamp, allowing him to leave the airport. Meanwhile, Amelia had 
    asked her "friend", actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair, to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, 
    but Viktor is disappointed to learn that she has rekindled her relationship with the man during this process. When he presents the emergency visa at customs, 
    Viktor is told that Dixon must sign the visa. But with Viktor's passport now valid again, Dixon is determined to immediately send him back to Krakozhia.
    He threatens Viktor that if he does not go home at once, he will cause trouble for his friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta Rajan back to India
    to face a charge of assaulting a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to return home. When Gupta learns of this, however, 
    he runs in front of the plane which would take Viktor back home, ensuring his deportation and taking the burden off Viktor. The delay gives Viktor enough time 
    to get into the city. Dixon orders his officers to arrest Viktor, but disillusioned with Dixon, they let him leave the airport. As Viktor is getting in a taxi, 
    Amelia arrives in another taxi, and they briefly smile and make eye-contact. Dixon himself arrives at the taxi-stand only moments after Viktor's taxi has left.
    When his officers arrive and one suggests immediately cordoning off the area and searching all vehicles to find him, Dixon, having had a change of heart, tells 
    them that they have incoming travelers to handle. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. 
    He gets in a taxi, telling the driver, "I am going home".

    ❀ The movie was inspired by the story of Merhan Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian refugee. In 1988, he landed at 
    Charles De Gaulle Airport near Paris, after being denied entry into England, because his passport and 
    United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. French authorities wouldn't let him leave the airport. 
    He remained in Terminal One, a stateless person with nowhere else to go. He has since been granted permission to
    either enter France or return to Iran. He chooses to continue to live in the terminal and tell his story to those 
    who will listen. Reportedly, his mental health has deteriorated over the years. When given the opportunity to live in France,
    he refused because the documents did not name him as "Sir Alfred", and he claims to have forgotten his native Persian. 
    Reportedly, he left the terminal in August 2006 to be hospitalized for an unspecified illness. 
    
    ❀ Spielberg traveled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length 
    of the production, but could not find one. The Terminal set was built in a massive hangar at the 
    LA/Palmdale Regional Airport. The hangar, part of the U.S. Air Force Plant 42 complex was used to build the 
    Rockwell International B-1B bomber. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on
    Düsseldorf Airport. The shape of both the actual terminal and the set viewed sideways is a cross-section of 
    an aircraft wing. 

    ❀ Krakozhia (Кракожия) is a fictional country, created for the film, that closely resembles a former Soviet Republic or an Eastern Bloc state.</h3>
