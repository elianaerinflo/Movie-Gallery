       <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    The Catholic Church mourns the sudden death of Pope Pius XVI, and prepares for the papal conclave to elect his successor in Vatican City. Father Patrick McKenna, 
    the camerlengo, takes temporary control of the Vatican during the sede vacante period. Meanwhile, at CERN, scientists Father Silvano Bentivoglio and Dr. Vittoria
    Vetra create three canisters of antimatter. As Vetra goes to evaluate the experiment, she discovers that Silvano has been murdered, and one of the canisters was
    stolen. Shortly thereafter, four of the preferiti, the favored candidates to be elected pope, are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the Illuminati.
    He sends the Vatican a warning, claiming he will murder each of the cardinals from 8 p.m. to midnight, when the stolen antimatter will explode and destroy
    the city, hidden somewhere within. Having caught the Church's attention after the events of The Da Vinci Code (2006), Harvard symbologist Professor Robert 
    Langdon embarks on a time-sensitive mission to unravel the mystery of a murdered Italian physicist and prevent a terrorist act against Vatican City. 
    After listening to the assassin's threat, he deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered on the four altars of the "Path of Illumination", in locations 
    relevant to the classical elements. McKenna gives Langdon access to the Vatican Secret Archives to research the altars, against the wishes of Commander Richter, 
    head of the Swiss Guard. Langdon and Dr. Vetra examine Galileo Galilei's banned book, finding clues to the first altar. Initially believing it to be at the 
    Pantheon, they eventually discover it to be the Chigi Chapel. Though they rush to the chapel, accompanied by Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the 
    Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, they are too late to save Cardinal Ebner, who is found dead, having suffocated on a mouthful of dirt and branded with the 
    ambigrammatic word "Earth". They verify the second altar's location and arrive, only to witness the death of the second cardinal, Cardinal Lamassa, his lungs 
    lacerated and his body branded with the word "Air." While Vetra studies Silvano's diaries, Langdon and the Vatican officers locate the third church and try to 
    save the third cardinal, Cardinal Gudiera, from burning to death, but the assassin appears and kills everyone but Langdon. The cardinal succumbs to the flames,
    his body branded with the word "Fire". After escaping, Langdon convinces two Carabinieri officers to race with him to the last church of the "Water" altar, but 
    the assassin murders the officers and drops the fourth cardinal, Cardinal Baggia, into the Fountain of the Four Rivers. However, Langdon saves the cardinal, 
    who tells him the location of the Illuminati's lair: Castel Sant'Angelo. When Langdon and Vetra arrive, they are confronted by the assassin, who spares their
    lives since they are not armed and he has not been paid to kill them. He reveals that his contractors were from the Catholic Church. The assassin escapes and
    finds a vehicle containing his payment, but is killed by a car bomb upon igniting the engine. Langdon and Vetra discover that the final victim of the plot will
    be Camerlengo McKenna. After arriving at the Vatican via a secret passage, they and some Swiss Guards enter the Camerlengo's office and find him in the floor
    branded with the Vatican's symbol on his chest and Commander Richter near him with a gun. The Guards promptly kill Richter to save the camerlengo. During the confusion, 
    the dying commander gives Langdon a key to his office. Then the camerlengo, Langdon, Vetra, and the Swiss Guards discover the location of the stolen antimatter vial. 
    By the time they find it, the battery is about to expire, the deadly explosion just minutes away. The camerlengo seizes the vial and uses a helicopter meant for
    escape from the Vatican to fly above the church. He then activates the autopilot and escapes with a parachute. After several seconds, the bomb explodes and the 
    camerlengo lands, now considered a hero by the crowd and even as the best candidate to be the new Pope by the College of Cardinals. Meanwhile, Langdon and Vetra use 
    Richter's key to watch a security video showing that the mastermind behind the murders of the original Pope and the preferiti and the antimatter robbery, in fact, 
    is the camerlengo and not the Illuminati. While Richter tries to arrest McKenna, the priest brands himself with a seal that resembles Saint Peter's upside-down 
    crucifixion and accuses the commander being a member of the Illuminati. Langdon shows the video to the College. After the camerlengo realizes his plot has been 
    uncovered, he immolates himself with oil from one of the 99 holy lamps inside St. Peter's Basilica after refusing to be alive. The Vatican also announces McKenna
    has died from injuries from his parachute landing, which leads to calls for sainthood (since the people are not aware that he was the mastermind). Cardinal Strauss, 
    the Pope's new camerlengo, gives Galileo's book to Langdon as thanks for his help, asking that he ensure it returns to the Vatican in his last will and testament.
    Pope Luke gives Langdon and Vetra a thankful nod, before stepping out on the balcony to greet the crowd below and give the traditional first Urbi et Orbi as pope.

    ❀ Crew members visited Vatican City as tourists and extensively photographed the city to capture as much detail as possible, knowing they were unlikelyto be allowed to 
    film there, so that they could recreate the sets as faithfully as possible.
    
     ❀ The theme "Chevaliers De Sangreal" by Hans Zimmer, in The Da Vinci Code (2006) was used again in the film now called "503" and later it was 
    re-used in Inferno (2016) now called "Life Must Have Its Own Mysteries". Zimmer, the composer for the three films, called it as the official Robert Langdon theme.

    ❀ Several cameos can be seen. A photo of Sophie Neveu (played by Audrey Tautou in The Da Vinci Code (2006) stands on a shelf at Langdon's house. 
    Ron Howard's wife, Cheryl Howard, plays a CERN scientist and his late father Rance Howard plays a Cardinal. 

    ❀ The production had to build a scale replica of St. Peter's Square since Vatican officials denied permission for the movie to be filmed on its grounds.

    ❀ At the very beginning, when the Columbia girl is standing holding aloft the torch, it flickers like the anti-matter.
