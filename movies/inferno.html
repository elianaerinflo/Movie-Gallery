        <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    Some time after helping the Vatican dealing with an antimatter threat, Harvard University professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in Florence, Italy. 
    He has no memory of the last few days, but is plagued with hellish visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks, the doctor tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as 
    a result of a bullet wound to the head. An orderly says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots
    the orderly while coming up the hallway. Brooks helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment. Among Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Brooks 
    find a Faraday pointer, a miniature image projector with a modified version of Sandro Botticelli's Map of Hell, which itself is based on Dante's Inferno. 
    They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a dangerously unstable villain who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to 
    reduce the Earth's growing population, and who committed suicide three days earlier after being chased by armed government agents. Langdon and Brooks figure out 
    that Zobrist, who was obsessed with Dante, has created a biological superweapon he has dubbed "Inferno", with the potential of annihilating half the world's 
    population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and government agents, who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The government
    agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called 
    "The Consortium", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability. Langdon's knowledge of Dante's work 
    and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and Venice, 
    while inadvertently killing Vayentha and evading the agents. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he helped a friend of his steal and hide the Dante death mask, a 
    crucial clue, an event he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the attack, to be broadcast after it has been released. 
    Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Brooks are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man purporting to be 
    working for the government, warning them that Sinskey is a double agent and is after the Inferno for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon 
    realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again. Langdon figures out that the attack is in 
    the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. With that knowledge, Brooks abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the weapon.
    Zobrist and Brooks used to play treasure hunt games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard, but
    Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals
    he was hired by Brooks to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with benzodiazepine to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were 
    all staged. They deduce the weapon is in a plastic bag hidden under water in the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The agents team -joined by Langdon, Sims, 
    and Sinskey - race to locate and secure the bag, while Brooks and fellow Zobrist disciples attempt to detonate an explosive to rupture the bag and aerosolize 
    the weapon. Sims incapacitates a disciple and kills another, but is fatally stabbed by Brooks who, refusing Langdon's pleas, releases the weapon by manually 
    triggering an underwater blast. The detonation ruptures the bag, which however is trapped by Sinskey in a special containment unit. After struggling against Sinskey 
    and Langdon to open the container, Brooks' last ally is killed by special units. The weapon is secured for analysis, while Langdon and Sinskey ruminate on the idealism 
    of youth and the future of humanity. Langdon returns to Florence and covertly returns the Dante Death Mask.

    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 

    ‚ùÄ In the book, it is revealed that Sienna abandoned her first name, Felicity, as a child. In the movie, she is played by Felicity Jones.

    ‚ùÄ This movie ends with Hans Zimmer's "Life Must Have Its Mysteries" soundtrack, which is very similar to "Chevaliers De Sangreal," the 
    ending soundtrack of The Da Vinci Code (2006), which was also composed by Zimmer.

    ‚ùÄ In the film, Christophe Bouchard turns out to be a traitor, and wants to retrieve the virus to sell it. In the book, he is named 
    Chistopher Bruder, and this plot point never happens; he remains a "good guy" throughout.
