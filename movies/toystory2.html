    <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    Woody and Buzz Lightyear are now the co-leaders of Andy's toys. Andy is preparing to take Woody to cowboy camp but accidentally rips Woody's arm during playtime, 
    choosing to leave him behind on the shelf. Woody discovers Wheezy, a toy penguin who has been forgotten by Andy after his squeaker broke. Andy's mother takes 
    Wheezy down to her yard sale; Woody saves Wheezy but is stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin. Buzz fails to rescue Woody but picks up two vital 
    clues: a feather from a chicken suit and the number plate of the car, both of which help Andy's toys realise who kidnapped Woody.

    At Al's apartment, Woody meets a cowgirl named Jessie, a horse named Bullseye and Stinky Pete the Prospector: all toys based on the main characters from 
    Woody's Roundup, a TV show that was very popular back in the 50s. Woody also learns that he and the Roundup gang are to be sold to a toy museum in Japan; he 
    states he cannot go because he needs to go home to Andy, earning resentment from Jessie. Al accidently rips Woody's arm off - when Woody tries to retrieve it, 
    the television in Al's apartment turns on, preventing him from getting back his arm. The next morning, Woody is repaired and still desires to go home to Andy;
    however, he soon learns that Jessie was once owned by a girl named Emily who eventually outgrew her and fears that Andy will do the same, so decides to stay 
    with the gang to go to Japan.

    Meanwhile, Buzz has enlisted the help of Slinky Dog, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and Hamm to rescue Woody. They reach Al's Toy Barn where Buzz is imprisoned by a 
    New Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes himself to be real space ranger. Andy's toys mistake the New Buzz for Andy's Buzz and he thinks they are on a 
    mission to defeat his arch nemesis, the Evil Emperor Zurg. The New Buzz leads the toys to hiding in Al's bag - Andy's Buzz escapes and follows the gang to 
    Al's apartment, unintentionally releasing a toy Zurg, who also believes he is the real Zurg and follows Buzz in order to destroy him.

    Woody is now excited to go to the museum in Japan. Buzz and the gang arrive; Buzz tries to persuade Woody to come home, but Woody remains adamant that Andy 
    will outgrow him and decides to go with the Roundup gang, devastating Buzz and the gang. When Woody comes to his senses, he asks the Roundup gang to come 
    with him and experience playtime from Andy. However, Stinky Pete prevents them from leaving, revealing he had previously sabotaged Woody's escape. Al takes 
    the roundup gang to the airport. Buzz and the gang give chase but are confronted by Zurg, who engages the New Buzz and reveals he is his father. Andy's toys 
    bid farewell to New Buzz and chase Al using a Pizza Planet truck and being accompanied by three squeak toy aliens. They arrive at the airport and manage to 
    subdue Stinky Pete, placing him in a little girl's backpack.

    Woody and Bullseye escape but Jessie is placed in the plane to Japan. Buzz, Woody and Bullseye work together to save Jessie and the whole gang returns to
    Andy's house. Andy fixes Woody's arm (which had been ripped again earlier by Stinky Pete). The toys are delighted to learn that Al has suffered financially 
    after losing the Roundup gang. Wheezy has also had his squeaker fixed, much to his happiness. Woody tells Buzz that he no longer fears Andy outgrowing him and 
    that even when it does eventually happen, he and Buzz will be friends 'for infinity and beyond.'

    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    ‚ùÄ For the scene where Woody looks at the merchandise from "Woody's Roundup", mock-ups of the toys were shown to Tom Hanks in the recording booth.
    Hanks' spontaneous reactions to the toys were recorded and used for Woody's dialogue.
    
    ‚ùÄ The dust in the scene where Woody meets Wheezy set a record for number of particles animated for a movie by computer.

    ‚ùÄ Many of the ideas that were not used in Toy Story (1995) appear in this film: the yard sale, and Woody's nightmare.
