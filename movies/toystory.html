    <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    In a world where toys come alive when humans aren't looking, a group of toys are preparing to move into a new house with their owner Andy Davis, his sister Molly and 
    their single mother. The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; pullstring cowboy doll Sheriff Woody, Andy's favorite toy and their leader, 
    sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift-opening with a baby monitor in hopes of calming the others. The other toys (which include Mr. Potato Head, 
    Slinky Dog, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Hamm the piggy bank and Bo Peep the porcelain doll) are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them. Andy then receives 
    a last-minute surprise gift from his mother- a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is a real space ranger. Buzz impresses and shows off to the other toys with 
    his various features, and becomes Andy's new favorite, making Woody jealous.

    Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy. To ensure Andy chooses him and 
    not Buzz, Woody tries to use the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys 
    (except for Bo and Slinky) suspect Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge. An angry Buzz 
    stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are 
    left behind.

    After a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant. However, Buzz mistakes a claw crane full of Little Green
    Men for a spaceship, and enters it, with Woody in pursuit. Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor Sid Phillips spots and captures the two, along with a Little Green Man, 
    and takes them to his house, where they encounter his vicious Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused "mutant" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.

    As Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that proves he is indeed a toy. In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and 
    falls into despair. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a rocket, planning to blow him to pieces, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the 
    launch until the next morning. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, while admitting his own insecurities. This conversation 
    restores Buzz's resolve, and the two work to get out of Sid's house. Just as Sid takes Buzz out to attempt to launch him, Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten 
    Sid into never harming toys again, freeing him and Buzz.

    Woody and Buzz pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody. Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and
    pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz. The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street. 
    Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error. During the chase, RC's batteries run 
    out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz. As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck. 
    Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing 
    safely beside Andy.

    At Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift-opening again while the other toys wait. Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a
    Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be "worse" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.

    ‚ùÄ Sid Phillips is said to be inspired by a former Pixar employee of the same last name who was known to disassemble toys and use the parts to build bizarre creations.
    
    ‚ùÄ This was the first animated film in Oscar history to be nominated for a Best Screenplay Academy Award - Adapted or Original.

    ‚ùÄ The animation team perfected the movement of the toy soldiers by nailing a pair of sneakers to a sheet of wood and trying to walk around with them on.
