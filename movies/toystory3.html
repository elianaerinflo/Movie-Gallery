    <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    Andy is 17 years old and preparing to leave for college. He has not played with his toys for years, and most have gone, except for Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie,
    Bullseye, Rex, Slinky, Hamm, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the Aliens, and three toy soldiers. As the despondent toys reflect on their future, the soldiers parachute 
    out the window and leave. Andy intends to take Woody to college, and puts the other toys into a trash bag, to be placed in the attic; however, Andy's mother 
    mistakenly puts the bag outside with the true garbage. The toys narrowly escape from the garbage truck, and, believing Andy deliberately threw them away, get into
    a donation box in Andy's mother's car with Molly's old Barbie doll. Woody follows in an attempt to bring them back, but is unable to convince the others of Andy's 
    real intentions, and goes along when Andy's mother takes the box of donations to Sunnyside Daycare.

    At Sunnyside, Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys, led by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"). The toys (except for Woody) are delighted to learn that Sunnyside 
    never runs out of children, and Barbie is enamored with a Ken doll. Woody attempts to return home, but is instead found by a child from Sunnyside named Bonnie, who 
    brings him home and plays with him and her other toys. Bonnie's toys are shocked that Woody escaped from Sunnyside. Chuckles, a toy clown, explains that he, Lotso, 
    and Big Baby were owned by a girl named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. When they made it home, Lotso found out that he had been replaced. Disregarding 
    Chuckles' protests, the embittered Lotso lied to Big Baby that Daisy had replaced all of them. They rode a truck to Sunnyside, where Lotso took over, turning it 
    into a toy prison. Chuckles was eventually broken and later found by Bonnie.

    After Andy's toys are subjected to a very rough playtime with the toddlers, Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room. Lotso allows Buzz to 
    go, but when Buzz insists that Andy's toys go as well, Lotso decides to switch Buzz to Demo mode. This resets Buzz to his original factory settings, causing him 
    to believe he's a real space ranger under Lotso's command. Meanwhile, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for his toys. 
    They realize that Woody was telling the truth about Andy's intentions and try to escape, but Lotso's henchmen, now assisted by the brainwashed Buzz, imprison them.
    Woody returns to Sunnyside, where a Chatter Telephone tells him that there is now only one way out - the trash. Later that night, the toys make their escape plan. 
    After successfully stealing the master key and disabling Lotso's night watchman, they attempt to restore Buzz, but Rex accidentally resets Buzz to Spanish mode. 
    Spanish Buzz immediately allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. Woody reveals Lotso's
    deception to Big Baby, who angrily throws Lotso into the dumpster. As a garbage truck approaches, the toys try to leave, but Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster. 
    The rest of Andy's toys jump after him, just as the truck arrives, and all fall inside.

    Buzz returns to normal after a television falls onto him inside the truck. The truck takes the toys to a landfill, where they are swept onto a conveyor belt that 
    leads to an incinerator. The Aliens spot an industrial claw, but are swept away while running toward it. After narrowly avoiding a shredder while trying to rescue 
    Lotso, Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them. The toys fall into the incinerator and resign themselves to their 
    apparent fate, but the Aliens, having made their way to the industrial claw, suddenly rescue them. Lotso is later found by a garbage truck driver, who fastens him 
    to his truck's radiator grille along with a few other toys. Woody and his friends ride another garbage truck back to Andy's house.

    Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie and is surprised 
    to find Woody at the bottom of the donation box. Bonnie recognizes him, and though initially hesitant, Andy passes Woody on to her, and they play together before he
    leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie. In the film's epilogue, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have vastly
    improved Sunnyside and maintain contact with Bonnie's toys through letters. The toy soldiers parachute into Sunnyside, where Ken and Barbie welcome them.

    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    ❀ Tom Hanks and Tim Allen insisted that they record their lines together, which they had previously done for one day during the making of the original 
    Toy Story (1995), but which is rarely done with animated films. They loved the chemistry their characters shared on-screen.
    
    ❀ For inspiration for the Sunnyside escape, the Pixar staff watched numerous prison movies. Director Lee Unkrich said, 
    "There are a lot of prison movies out there, and I think we watched every single one of them."

    ❀ For Big Baby's one line for the entire movie ("Mama"), the crew had a lot of babies audition by recording them saying the line. 
    The baby that was chosen was named Woody. In fact, director Lee Unkrich joked that was the reason why they chose that baby.
