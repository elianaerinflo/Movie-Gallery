    <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    At a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999, elderly retiree Paul Edgecomb becomes emotional while viewing the film Top Hat. His companion Elaine becomes concerned,
    and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of events that he witnessed when he was an officer at Cold Mountain Penitentiary's death row, nicknamed 
    "The Green Mile". In 1935, Paul supervises Corrections Officers Brutus "Brutal" Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger, and Percy Wetmore, reporting to 
    chief warden Hal Moores. Percy, the nephew of the state governor's wife, demonstrates a sadistic streak but flaunts his family connections to avoid being 
    held accountable; he is particularly abusive towards prisoner Eduard "Del" Delacroix, breaking his fingers and killing his pet mouse Mr. Jingles. Paul is
    introduced to John Coffey, a physically imposing but mild-mannered African-American man sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering 
    two young white girls. He joins two other condemned convicts on the block: Del, and Arlen Bitterbuck, the latter of whom is the first to be executed. 
    Meanwhile, the officers are forced to deal with psychotic new inmate William "Wild Bill" Wharton, who frequently causes trouble by assaulting the officers 
    and racially abusing John, forcing them to restrain him in the block's padded cell on more than one occasion. After John heals Paul's severe bladder 
    infection by touching him and later resurrecting Mr. Jingles, Paul gradually realizes that John possesses a supernatural ability to heal others. 
    Suspecting that John is endowed with the power to perform divine miracles, Paul doubts whether he is truly guilty of his crimes.
    
    In exchange for resigning from the penitentiary and accepting a job at an insane asylum, Percy is allowed to oversee Del's execution. At the execution, Percy 
    deliberately avoids soaking the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head, leading to Del suffering a gruesome and agonizing death, with John forced to
    feel Del's pain as well. Paul and the other officers bind and gag Percy as punishment for his actions and force him to spend a night in the padded cell. While 
    Percy is locked away, they secretly smuggle John out of the prison so that he can use his powers to heal Warden Moores' wife Melinda of a brain tumor, saving her 
    life. After Percy is released from the padded room, the others threaten to report him for his various acts of misconduct if his behavior continues. John uses his 
    powers to "release" Melinda's affliction into Percy's brain, causing Percy to shoot Wild Bill to death. Soon after, John reveals in a vision to Paul that Wild 
    Bill was the true culprit of the crimes for which he was wrongfully condemned, releasing his supernatural energy into Paul in the process. Having suffered a 
    mental breakdown, Percy is committed to the same insane asylum where he had planned to work after resigning from the prison. Finally realizing that John is 
    innocent, Paul is distraught at the thought of executing him, and offers to let him go free. John tells Paul that the execution would be an act of mercy, as 
    he views the world as a cruel place, and is in constant pain from the suffering that people inflict upon each other. 
    
    Mentioning that he has never seen a movie before, John watches Top Hat with the other officers as a last request. When executed later that night, he asks 
    not to have a hood placed over his head, as he is afraid of the dark. The officers all watch in sadness, visibly holding back tears as Coffey is executed.
    Back in the present, Paul tells Elaine that John's was the last execution that he and Brutal witnessed, as they both subsequently resigned from the prison 
    and took jobs in the juvenile system. Concluding his story, Paul reveals that Del's mouse Mr. Jingles is still alive; having been blessed with a 
    supernaturally long life thanks to John's healing touch. He also reveals that he himself is now 108 years old, having been 44 at the time of John's execution.
    While Elaine sees Paul's long life as another of John's miracles, Paul speculates that it may be a divine punishment and that he has been condemned to linger 
    on Earth and outlive all of his loved ones for killing John. Paul is later shown attending Elaine's funeral, and muses on how much longer he has left to live.

    ‚ùÄAccording to one of the featurettes on the DVD, Stephen King called this film the single most faithful adaptation of his work.

    ‚ùÄ Coffey's bed was built shorter in order to make Michael Clarke Duncan look like a giant.

    ‚ùÄ Originally, Tom Hanks was going to play the older Paul Edgecomb, but the makeup tests did not make him look credible enough to be an elderly man. 
    Dabbs Greer was cast instead as the older Paul Edgecomb.
