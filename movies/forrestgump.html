       <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    In 1981, at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, a man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) recounts his life story to strangers who happen to sit next to him on the bench. 
    As a boy in 1956, Forrest has an IQ of 75 and is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine. He lives in Greenbow, Alabama with his mother (Sally Field), who 
    runs a boarding house and encourages him to live beyond his disabilities. She lavishes him with love and sends him on his way with a smorgasbord of tidbits of 
    wisdom, such as, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, 
    and the two become best friends. Bullied because of his leg braces and dim-witted appearance, Forrest flees from a group of children, but when his braces break 
    off, he is revealed to be a fast runner. With this talent, he receives a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1962, where he is coached by 
    Bear Bryant, becomes a top kick returner, is named to the All-American team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House. In his first year at college,
    he witnesses Governor George Wallace's Stand in the Schoolhouse Door and returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones, one of the students admitted over state
    resistance. After graduating college in 1966, Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. During basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier named Benjamin Buford Blue 
    (nicknamed "Bubba")(Mykelti Williamson), who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. Later that year, they are sent to
    Vietnam, serving with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta region under Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise). After months of routine operations, their
    platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoonmates - and Lieutenant Dan, who loses both his legs.
    Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson. At an anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman 
    and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has become a drug-addicted hippie and anti-war activist. He also develops a talent for ping-pong, and becomes a sports 
    celebrity competing against Chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside John Lennon of the Beatles on The Dick Cavett Show.
    Forrest spends 1972 New Year's Eve in New York City with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an alcoholic, still bitter about his disability and the government's
    apathy towards Vietnam veterans. Forrest's ping-pong success eventually leads to a meeting with President Richard Nixon. For this event, he is given a room
    in the Watergate complex, where he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal. Discharged from the army, Forrest returns to Greenbow and endorses a company 
    that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in Bayou La Batre, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest
    in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane Carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and 
    create the profitable Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Dan invests in early Apple stock, which Forrest 
    thinks is "some kind of fruit company", and the two become millionaires. Forrest gives half of his earnings to Bubba's family for having inspired the shrimping 
    venture. Forrest returns home to his mother and cares for her during her terminal illness from cancer. In 1976, Jenny - recovering from years of drugs and abuse 
    - returns to visit Forrest. He proposes to her, and that night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, though she leaves the next morning. 
    Heartbroken, Forrest goes running "for no particular reason" and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous for another
    feat before returning to Greenbow. In 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. 
    Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, who introduces him to their young son, whom she named Forrest Gump Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an "unknown virus". 
    The three move back to Greenbow and Jenny and Forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. The film ends with Forrest sending his son off on his first day of school.
