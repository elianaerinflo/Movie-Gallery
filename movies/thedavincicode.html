    <fieldset style="color: #533535; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; border: 3px solid #3A6351">
    <pre style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 50px; margin-inline: 20px; line-height: 200%;"> 
    Jacques Sauni√®re, a Louvre curator, is pursued through the Grand Gallery by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who demands the location of the Priory's "keystone" 
    to find and destroy the Holy Grail. Sauni√®re gives him a false lead and is murdered. The police find his body posed like Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. Police captain Bezu 
    Fache has his lieutenant, J√©r√¥me Collet, summon American symbologist Robert Langdon, who is in Paris for a lecture on the interpretation of symbols, to examine
    Sauni√®re's body.

    Langdon is shown the body and a secret message, readable only by blacklight. It contains an out-of-order Fibonacci sequence. Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer 
    and Sauni√®re's granddaughter, tells Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him after finding the words, "P.S. Find Robert Langdon" at the end of Sauni√®re's secret 
    message. Fache believes that Langdon murdered Sauni√®re. Sophie throws away the tracker, distracting the police while they sneak around the Louvre, finding more 
    clues in Leonardo da Vinci's works. Langdon deduces that Sauni√®re was the grand master of the Priory of Sion. Silas works for an anonymous person referred to as 
    "The Teacher", along with members of Opus Dei, led by Bishop Aringarosa. Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich and access Sauni√®re's safe 
    deposit box by using the Fibonacci sequence. Inside is a cryptex, a cylindrical container that contains a message on papyrus. It can only be opened without 
    destroying the contents by turning dials to spell a code word. As police arrive, bank manager Andre Vernet helps Langdon and Sophie escape, then attempts to
    steal the cryptex and murder them. Langdon and Sophie escape with the cryptex.

    They visit Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert. Teabing claims the Grail is not a cup but instead is Mary Magdalene. He says she was
    not a prostitute but the wife of Jesus Christ. Teabing argues that Mary was pregnant during His crucifixion, and the Priory formed to protect their descendants.
     The Opus Dei have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the Vatican. Later, Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing, who uses
    crutches, uses one to disable him. The group escapes to London via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. Their interpretation of a clue 
    hidden in the cryptex box leads them to the Temple Church, where they find nothing. Remy, who claims to be the Teacher, frees Silas. Remy takes Teabing 
    hostage, dumping him in the car trunk, and taking Silas to hide out in an Opus Dei safe house. Teabing, who is revealed as the Teacher, later poisons Remy
    and sends the police after Silas. Police shoot Silas after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache, who resents being used 
    to hunt Langdon.

    Teabing, who wants to bring down the Church for centuries of persecution and deceit, confronts Langdon and Sophie. Now understanding the true meaning 
    behind the clue to unlock the cryptex, the trio goes to Westminster Abbey to the tomb of Sir Isaac Newton, a former grand master of the Priory. Teabing 
    demands that the pair open the cryptex. Langdon tries and seemingly fails before suddenly tossing the cryptex into the air. Teabing dives for it, catches
    it, but the vial breaks, and the papyrus is thought destroyed. The police arrive to arrest Teabing, who realizes Langdon must have solved the cryptex's 
    code and removed the papyrus before throwing it. The code is revealed to be "APPLE", after the apocryphal myth of the apple which led Newton to discover 
    his law of universal gravitation. The clue inside the cryptex, which tells of the Grail hiding "'neath the rose," leads Langdon and Sophie to Rosslyn Chapel
    in Scotland.

    Inside the chapel, they discover a secret room where Magdalene's tomb has been removed. Langdon, after searching through documents, realizes that Sophie's 
    family died in a car crash, that Sauni√®re was not her grandfather but her protector, and that she is the last descendant of Jesus Christ. The two are greeted
    by several members of the Priory, including Sophie's grandmother, who promises to protect her. Langdon and Sophie part ways, the former returning to Paris. 
    While shaving, he cuts himself and has an epiphany when his blood curves down the sink, reminding him of the Rose Line. Realizing the true meaning of the cryptex 
    clue, he follows the line to the Louvre, concluding the Holy Grail is hidden below the Pyramide Invers√©e. Langdon kneels atop it and the sarcophagus of Mary 
    Magdalene is seen in a secret underground chamber.

    ‚ùÄ The poster outside the elevator in the Louvre is Caravaggio's "The Boy in the Well". This represents Langdon's falling in a well as a boy.
    
    ‚ùÄ Dan Brown named character Sir Leigh Teabing after two of the authors, Richard Leigh and Michael Baigent, of the book 
    "Holy Blood, Holy Grail." Leigh is the surname of Richard Leigh and Teabing is an anagram of the surname Baigent. Leigh and Baigent 
    unsuccessfully attempted to sue Brown for copyright infringement.
